Then, on **desktop**, do the following: Open File > Import > ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc. Read [more about Evernote import](https://joplinapp.org/help/#importing-from-evernote).\\\n\\\n# Importing from other apps\\\n\\\nJoplin can also import notes from [many other apps](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-other-applications) as well as [from Markdown or text files](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-markdown-files).\\\n\\\n# Exporting notes\\\n\\\nJoplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is an archive that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a format mostly designed for backup purposes. You may also export to other formats such as plain Markdown files, to JSON or to PDF. Find out [more about exporting notes](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#exporting) on the official website.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1426}]"
